# BHE-Phantom_Script_Snap_Studio


 Scripts for Snap Lens Studio

Add these scripts to the Snap Lens Studio Process in the resources flders and then use these in the target texture.

Behaviour.js is an prebuiltsnapchat script (serves like a library to make API calls).

Random Image Script.js is our script that references to behaviour.js to perform functions. Please make all edits to this script and not behaviour.js script
